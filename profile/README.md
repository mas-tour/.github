# MasTour

**MasTour** is an application that engaged in the field of tourism, culture, and hospitality. Developed by **C23-PS232** team as part of the Capstone Project at [Bangkit Academy 2023](https://bangkit.academy). The team consists of three different learning paths: Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development.

# About The Project

Hiring a tour guide for a trip can be challenging for tourists, as they often have to go through travel agencies that often offer limited options and take visitors to popular tourist spots they have affiliations with to boost their revenue. This approach may not offer an authentic and personalized experience of the local culture and ‘hidden gems’. To solve this problem, MasTour has been developed. 

MasTour connects tourists directly with local freelance tour guides, providing a more **personalized** and **authentic** travel experience. This application aims to promote hidden gem destinations that are not typically included in mainstream travel itineraries, enabling travelers to explore and appreciate the cultural and natural richness of each destination while supporting local tourism growth. 

**With MasTour, travelers can enjoy a unique and unforgettable travel experience while supporting local tourism growth.**
